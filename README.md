# Underwater-Shark-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
This project focuses on detecting underwater species, specifically sharks, using object detection algorithms. The goal is to develop an effective and resource-efficient model to accurately identify sharks in images captured by Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVs).
